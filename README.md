# TIC-TAC-TOE
This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game developed in C, designed as a part of my programming practice. The game allows a player to compete against the computer or another player (based on your version). It runs in the terminal and uses basic C concepts like loops, arrays, conditional statements, and functions.





2. Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game using C.
The program should allow two players to take turns, display the game board, check for valid moves, and determine the winner or a draw.




3. How to Compile and Run

Compile the Program

gcc tictactoe.c -o tictactoe

Run the Program

./tictactoe

Make sure the .c file name in the command matches your file.



4. Sample Output (Optional)

TIC TAC TOE

   Player 1 (X)  -  Player 2 (O)

   1 | 2 | 3
  ---+---+---
   4 | 5 | 6
  ---+---+---
   7 | 8 | 9

Player 1, enter a position: 1

X | 2 | 3
--+---+--
4 | 5 | 6
